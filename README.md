This project is design [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) and coded by [me](https://github.com/Hikmahx). [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io) help to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

I built this project along with [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs provided.

 [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) are the frameworks used in the development of the project.

In this project, there are eight default countries on the homepage. Using the select form, you can view all countries in a specific region. Countries can also be searched `input` field which redirects to details page. In the details page, clicking on the border button leads you to its country detail. 

Finally, the moon icon and `Dark Mode` can be toggled on click.
