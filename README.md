## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com) - Icons



### What I learned
I not only learned how to implement my newly acquired skills in Next.js, but I was also able to correct some mistakes I had made when I first did this projec. I had completed this project about a year ago and recently decided to retry it using Next.js with TypeScript. I am proud of the way I identified my errors and was able to rectify them.
